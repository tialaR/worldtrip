### 👩🏾‍🚀 Journey Ignite Rocketseat Module 04 Challenge 01 - Create an web application with Chakra UI, ReactJS and Next.js

<p>
In this challenge I created an application using ReactJS together with Next.js.
In it I had two main objectives.
The first was to develop the entire interface based on the Chakra UI. The second was to work on the responsive layout of the application.
